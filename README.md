## Strategy
This application is a hybrid MPA and SPA. Tere is a separate page for signup/signin. Once a user is logged in they are redirected to the / view which then renders the SPA application created using React and Vite.

## Creating a new application
1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:dittonjs/2610DjangoViteStarter.git <your-new-project-name>`. Replace `<your-new-project-name>` with the name you want give to your project.
   - If you are using GitHub for version control, a better option would be to fork the repository instead of clone it.
3. Open the pyproject.toml file and change the `name` property. You should use `-` to separate words in your name for this property.
4. This project was set up using Python 3.11. You might have an older version installed. If you run into an error later that says that your activated Python version isn't compatible, the in the pyproject.toml file, just change the version there to match the version that you have installed. If you do this, you need to make sure that the lock file gets regenerated. You can do this by running `poetry lock --no-update` or by simply deleting the poetry.lock file (it will get regenerated when you run poetry install)/

## Initial Setup
1. Change the name property in the `pyproject.toml` file to be something unique to your project.
1. In the root directory, install the python dependencies `poetry install`
2. In the `client` directory, install the javascript dependencies `npm install`
3. In the `_server` directory, create a new file called `.env`
4. Copy the contents of `_server/.env.example` into the newly created `.env` file.
5. Activate the poetry env `poetry shell`
6. In the `_server` directory, run the migrations `python manage.py migrate`

## Running the appliction
1. In the `client` directory run `npm run dev`
2. In the `_server` directory (with your poetry env activated) run `python manage.py runserver`
3. Visit your application at `http://localhost:8000`
